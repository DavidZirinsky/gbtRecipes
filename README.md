# gbtRecipies A Recipe Generator For Any Dish You Can Think Of  ðŸ“–

**gbtRecipies** is a sample app that queries the OpenAI API to generate any recipe you want via the `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` model. 

You'll have to provide your own Api Key as I'm not made of Money ðŸ’°

## How To Build This: ðŸ› 
We all know that android studio can be finnicky importing projects. This project was build with Android Studio version: `Android Studio Flamingo | 2022.2.1 Patch 2` so I'd recommend matching that version of Android Studio if you're having issues importing this project. 


## I Don't Want To Read Through Your Code, What's The Magical Curl Command? ðŸ’» 
This also does the magic for ya, no app required. We can make use of the new ability of OpenAi's api to output json with a sepcific schema: 
```
curl --location 'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE' \
--data '{
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Provide a recipe for spaghetti bolognese"}
  ],
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "set_recipe",
      "parameters": {

	      }
	    },
